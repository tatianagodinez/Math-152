As the loop of `is_prime` goes on and on, it might take your computer a long time!  If each step of the loop takes only a nanosecond (1 billionth of a second), the loop would take about a second when executing `is_prime(1000000001)`.

It just remembers the endpoints, and how to proceed from one number to the next.  In the older version, Python 2.x, the range command `range(2,n)` would have tried to store the entire list of numbers `[2,3,4,...,n-1]` in the memory of your computer.  Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.  (More detail about this later!).  So a gigabyte will not even hold a billion numbers.  So our `is_prime` function would have led to memory problems in Python 2.x, but in Python 3.x we don't have to worry (for now) about space."
